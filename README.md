Tihs is an attempt to make the broken Radio Configuration Utility work again. 

I decompiled the original, patched the source to change how it checked to see if the changes to the host computers IP address had worked and recompiled.

I decompiled using Vineflower

I edited and recompiled using Intillij community edition. 

To use, simply copy the modified FRCWpaKiosk.jar over the original in the C:\Program Files (x86)\FRC Radio Configuration Utility\lib folder. 

Hopefully this helps some people.  My anger and frustration over trying to make the broken tool work will hopefully be at an end. 

This is a quick and dirty fix and I don't really know what I'm doing so use at your own risk, but so far it works for me.
